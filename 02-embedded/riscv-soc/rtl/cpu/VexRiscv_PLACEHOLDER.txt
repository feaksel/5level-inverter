# VexRiscv Core Placeholder
# ===========================

VexRiscv core file should be named: VexRiscv.v

The automated download failed due to network restrictions.

## Manual Download Options:

### Option 1: Direct Download (Recommended)
1. Visit: https://github.com/SpinalHDL/VexRiscv
2. Go to "Releases" section
3. Download a pre-built VexRiscv.v file
4. Place it in this directory: 02-embedded/riscv-soc/rtl/cpu/VexRiscv.v

### Option 2: Clone and Generate
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SpinalHDL/VexRiscv.git
cd VexRiscv
sbt "runMain vexriscv.demo.GenSmallest"
cp VexRiscv.v /path/to/5level-inverter/02-embedded/riscv-soc/rtl/cpu/
```

### Option 3: Use Pre-existing File
If you already have VexRiscv.v from another project, copy it here.

## For Testing Without VexRiscv:

The current wrapper has a stub implementation that allows synthesis and
simulation without the actual VexRiscv core. This is useful for:
- Testing peripherals
- Verifying memory system
- Checking bus connectivity
- FPGA resource estimation

However, firmware will NOT execute without the real core.

## Required VexRiscv Configuration:

- ISA: RV32IMC minimum
- Bus: Wishbone (both instruction and data buses)
- Interrupts: External interrupt support
- Features: Hardware multiply/divide recommended

Port names should include:
- iBusWishbone_* (instruction bus)
- dBusWishbone_* (data bus)
- externalInterrupt
- clk
- reset (active HIGH)

See vexriscv_wrapper.v for expected port mapping.
